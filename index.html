    <p><strong>Tiramisu</strong> is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi)
         dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, flavoured with cocoa.</p>
         <br />
         <p>Traditional tiramisu contains a short list of ingredients: ladyfingers (savoiardi), 
            egg yolks, sugar, coffee, mascarpone cheese, and cocoa powder. A common variant involves soaking the savoiardi in alcohol, such as Marsala wine,
             amaretto or a coffee-based liqueur, but this is not mentioned in the original recipe. "The original shape of Tiramesù at Le Beccherie was circular.</p>

             <h3>Preparation</h3>
             <dl>
                <dt><b>Step 1</b></dt>
                    <dd>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until 
                very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. 
                Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</dd>
                <dt><b>Step 2</b></dt>
                <dd>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. 
                    Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. 
                    Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</dd>
                <dt><b>Step 3</b></dt>
                <dd>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</dd>
                <dt><b>Step 4</b></dt>
                <dd>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- 
                    and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until you’ve got an even layer, breaking the 
                    ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). 
                    Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.</dd>
